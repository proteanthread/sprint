1. WHAT IS SPRINT

SPRINT is emulator of Sprinter (flex computer with z80
processor, see http://www.petersplus.com for details).
We emulate OS Estex as interface to real OS of emulator.
We don't emulate SPECTRUM mode yet, but it's possible in
the future. We developed this project in C++ for using
object-oriented technique and portability. 

Default video mode is 640x480 with 256 colors. If you
have any problems with this mode, edit SPRINT.INI file.
Now you may use windowed mode for SDL version of SPRINT.
Developed for  WIN9X (SDL+DirectX), MS-DOS (DOS4GW), 
LINUX (svgalib) and LINUX (SDL+X11).

We used SDL library v1.2.4 for Windows and v1.0.8 for
Linux (see http://www.libsdl.org).


2. START

Variants of start:

sprint_fn (or sprint fn.exe)
sprint_menu (or sprint menu.exe)
sprint fan256.exe
sprint fish.exe
sprint flames.exe
sprint forth.exe
sprint psy.exe
sprint sd.exe
sprint starway.exe
cpm

SPRINT.EXE - for Windows + SDL (SDL.dll included)
sprint - for Linux + SDL (X11 and libSDL needed)
sprintvga - for Linux + svgalib (svgalib needed)

During emulation SPRINT fills DEBUG.OUT file.
It's disassembled trace of Z80 processor and
it may be really big! See SPRINT.INI for on/off.

F2 - Save 64K memory to memory.dat file;
F9 - Save screenshot in Targa format (TGA);
F10 - End of work.


3. SUPPORTED FUNCTIONS

At present, a number of supported functions is not
too big, namely:

Accelerator: all

Bios  (RST #08): 
#81,#82,#83,#84,#85,#86,#87,#88,#89,#8A,#8B,#8C,#8D,#8E,
#A1,#A4,#C0,#C1,#C2,#C3,#C4,#C5,#C6,#C7,#EF

#40,#41,
#50,#51,#52,#53,#54,#55,#56,#57,#58,#59,#5A,#5B,#5C
else jump to real SYSTEM.DOS

Mouse (RST #30): 
#00,#03


4. HOW TO HELP US

If you want develope unsupported function of bios or estex,
please try develop it and send it to us. 

If you want modify supported function and think that it's
good modification or bugfix, that you need contact us for
discussing of your modifications.

For compiling we used:
- Makefile for GCC under Linux and SDL (X11);
- Makefile.vga for GCC under Linux and svgalib;
- MK.BAT for Watcom-C/C++ under MS-DOS + DOS4GW;
- C_MK.BAT for Visual-C++ 6.0 under Windows + SDL;
Don't forget to edit C_SDL.BAT and MK.BAT for your system!
